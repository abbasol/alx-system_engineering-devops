postmortem



Issue Summary:
Duration: The outage lasted from May 9, 2024, 10:00 AM to May 9, 2024, 12:45 PM EDT.
Impact: Approximately 65% of users experienced slow responses or timeouts when accessing our web application, resulting in failed transactions and degraded user experience.
Root Cause: The primary cause was a misconfigured load balancer which incorrectly routed database traffic, overwhelming a single server.
Timeline:
10:00 AM - The first reports of slow system responses were logged by our automated monitoring system.
10:15 AM - Customer support received multiple complaints about transaction failures, triggering a deeper investigation.
10:30 AM - Initial investigation by the DevOps team focused on web servers and application logs, assuming an application error.
11:00 AM - Further analysis indicated normal operations in web services; attention shifted to database performance.
11:20 AM - Discovered uneven load distribution on database servers; one server was handling significantly more traffic than others.
11:30 AM - Misconfigurations found in the load balancer settings for database traffic routing.
11:45 AM - Network Operations team engaged to assist with load balancer configuration issues.
12:00 PM - Corrected load balancer configurations and initiated a controlled restart of the load balancer.
12:45 PM - System functionality confirmed restored, normal operation levels observed, and monitoring continued to ensure stability.
Root Cause and Resolution:
Root Cause: The root cause was traced back to a recent update in the load balancer configuration which inadvertently directed a disproportionate amount of database traffic to a single database server. This overwhelmed the server, leading to slow response times and timeouts.
Resolution: The configuration error in the load balancer was corrected to ensure even traffic distribution among all database servers. The load balancer was then restarted to apply the changes, which restored the system to its normal operational state.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:
To prevent future occurrences of this issue and improve the overall resilience of our systems, we are implementing the following measures:
Review and update all load balancer configurations: Ensure that they are set correctly and are reviewed after each change.
Enhanced monitoring for load distribution: Implement improved monitoring that specifically checks for load balance across database servers.
Tasks to Address the Issue:
Patch Load Balancer Software: Update the load balancer to the latest stable software version that contains additional safety checks for configuration issues.
Add Monitoring on Database Server Load: Implement new monitoring metrics on the load being handled by each database server.
